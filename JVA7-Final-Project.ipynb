    "My metric is about the slope of streets in Pittsburgh. The best neighborhood in my opinion would have streets that are not too steep to bike up and down. I believe in global warming and I believe one of the best ways to combat it is by biking instead of driving. It is easiest to bike when you live in a good neighborhood with under 25% slope. This also makes it a lot easier to walk around without tiring out."
